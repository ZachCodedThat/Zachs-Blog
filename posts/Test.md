# Starting from Scratch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit here writing this with my back squarely up against the wall. I was let go from my job and I have been presented with a golden opportunity most do not get at 30. I have time to fully give myself over to learning a new skill and really take a shot at changing my career path and pursue something I actually want to do. I have a support system of people who have provided knowledge, experience and support at every step of this adventure and have given me the confidence in myself to see this through.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to document this experience pass or fail because if I can inspire even one person to pursue what they really want to do in life it's all worth it to me.

Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/ZachCodedThat?tab=repositories) so you can see what I have been struggling with recently.

# Why bother??

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good question, at this point id rather take the leap, fail and go get another job pushing numbers around spreadsheets all day. They are easy and pay relatively well, butttt and this is a **biggg** but it is incredibly soul crushingly boring and that is something I can't overlook anymore. The thought of not at least taking the shot at a career shift would be a disservice to myself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coding for me provides something visceral that struck a cord somewhere deep and it hasn't stopped resonating since it's been plucked. What I once thought of as an impenetrable garden where only a few extremely smart people reside is completely open to those willing to put the time and effort into learning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went from having a small amount of free time that I did not want to give fully to the process because I have a life and when you know a paycheck is showing up week over week the urgency for change takes a backseat. Now I have more time then I know what to do with and I plan to make the most out of it.

# Setting the scene

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soo where do we stand? About 9 months ago at the onset of this journey where making text bold on my Myspace page when I was 13 was the pinnacle of my coding prowess, I started small and built a foundation of the basics, things like basic JS, HTML and CSS cramming as many tutorials, YouTube videos and articles into the limited time I set out for it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing those early results of those things work and produce something tangible I can see working is a feeling I did not know I wanted until it happened. Even when things go wrong the debugging process is a wonderful critical thinking tool for problem solving and really helps me understand the subject matter which has helped me in more aspects of life then just coding.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I have a much more focused approach to what I want to learn as opposed to the grab-bag approach I had at the jump. Let's be super real I don't know shit but what I lack right now in knowledge I make up for it by absorbing all the information I can and trying to put as much of it into practice as possible. I have played enough complicated video games to understand that the more time spent actually playing the game the better your understanding/performance of it becomes.

# So what now?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you made it this far down the page without vomiting big props. I will post about stuff I am working on/with to get better at writing and to solidify the knowledge for that thing. I have no set theme and like with most things will wing it and see what happens.
